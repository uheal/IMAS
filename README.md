# IMAS - Integrated Medical Agentic System

## Introduction
Since the onset of COVID-19, rural communities worldwide have faced significant
challenges in accessing healthcare due to the migration of experienced medical
professionals to urban centers. Semi-trained caregivers, such as Community Health
Workers (CHWs) and Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs), have stepped in
to fill this gap, but often lack formal training. This paper proposes an advanced
agentic medical assistant system designed to improve healthcare delivery in rural
areas by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic approaches. The
system is composed of five crucial components: translation, medical complexity as-
sessment, expert network integration, final medical advice generation, and response
simplification. Our innovative framework ensures context-sensitive, adaptive, and
reliable medical assistance, capable of clinical triaging, diagnostics, and identifying
cases requiring specialist intervention. The system is designed to handle cultural
nuances and varying literacy levels, providing clear and actionable medical advice
in local languages. Evaluation results show that this integrated approach signifi-
cantly enhances the effectiveness of rural healthcare workers, making healthcare
more accessible and understandable for underserved populations.
